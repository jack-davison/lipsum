<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lipsum is to get easy access to several "Lorem Ipsum" web APIs to simply generate customisable placeholder text. In the R world, this will most likely commonly be used within RMarkdown/Quarto documents and Shiny apps.

The `{lorem}` package also serves a similar purpose, but `{lipsum}`'s interfacing with a variety of APIs may allow for more flexible placeholder outputs. For example, the `loripsum()` function gives a lot of control of the kinds of features the placeholder text should have (for example, lists, links, headers, and so on).

`{lipsum}` owes a lot to the [awesome-ipsum](https://github.com/templeman/awesome-ipsum) list, and uses its same categorisations:

* **Practical**, which are placeholder generators that are most useful for "professional" settings. These either generate text in Latin, or business-sounding text like newspaper articles.

* **Whimsical**, which are more playful generators which impersonate celebrities, list the names of dinosaurs, use profanity, and so on. These are perhaps more appropriate for personal projects!

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{lipsum}` like so:

``` r
#install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jack-davison/lipsum")
```

## Example

The below code generates example lorem ipsum generated using the [loripsum API](https://loripsum.net). This is the most useful, customisable function in the package, and is probably most appropriate for professional use.

```{r example}
ipsum <- lipsum::loripsum(n = 3, decorate = TRUE, ol = TRUE, bq = TRUE)
```

In R, the output looks like this:

```{r r, results='markup'}
cat(ipsum)
```

Using GitHub markdown, this ends up looking like:

```{r md, results='asis'}
cat(ipsum)
```

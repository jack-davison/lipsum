I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise–at least he
feared it.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
so panther-like in the movement–something so unhuman, that it seemed to
sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker,
who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into
the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort
of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed;
but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like
disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all
advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised
plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I
did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything.
Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great
Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a
powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count’s leap back
saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his
heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a
wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out.
The expression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for a moment I
feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again
for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective
impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty
power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the
monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each
one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and
baffled malignity–of anger and hellish rage–which came over the Count’s
face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his
burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin
like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept
under Harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of
the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the
window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into
the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could
hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the
flagging.
</p>
<p>
We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
There he turned and spoke to us:–

</summary><p>HP Lovecraft All I say is that I think it is damned unlikely that
anything like a central cosmic will, a spirit world, or an eternal
survival of personality exist. They are the most preposterous and
unjustified of all the guesses which can be made about the universe, and
I am not enough of a hair-splitter to pretend that I don’t regard them
as arrant and negligible moonshine. In theory I am an agnostic, but
pending the appearance of radical evidence I must be classed,
practically and provisionally, as an atheist. To be bitter is to
attribute intent and personality to the formless, infinite, unchanging
and unchangeable void. We drift on a chartless, resistless sea. Let us
sing when we can, and forget the rest.. Contrary to what you may assume,
I am not a pessimist but an indifferentist- that is, I don’t make the
mistake of thinking that the… cosmos… gives a damn one way or the other
about the especial wants and ultimate welfare of mosquitoes, rats, lice,
dogs, men, horses, pterodactyls, trees, fungi, dodos, or other forms of
biological energy. At night, when the objective world has slunk back
into its cavern and left dreamers to their own, there come inspirations
and capabilities impossible at any less magical and quiet hour. No one
knows whether or not he is a writer unless he has tried writing at
night. There are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to
them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we
learn and dream, we think but half-formed thoughts, and when as men we
try to remember, we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life. But
some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills
and gardens, of fountains that sing in the sun, of golden cliffs
overhanging murmuring seas, of plains that stretch down to sleeping
cities of bronze and stone, and of shadowy companies of heroes that ride
caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests; and then we
know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of
wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappy.</p>

</summary><p>This is not to discredit the idea that a badger of the beggar is
assumed to be a raring pear. A newsstand sees an algebra as a midships
fish. A sensate gondola’s football comes with it the thought that the
psycho temper is a bangle. Those periods are nothing more than
jeeps.</p>
Some assert that couches are dangling whorls. The trochoid plow comes

Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
any hitherto–a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between
the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
</p>
<p>
There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
tombstones–“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in the
Whitby vernacular–actually project over where the sustaining cliff has
fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified
just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
</p>
<p>
It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actually lashed to the wheel.

</summary><p>Michael Caine Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because
some men aren’t looking for anything logical, like money. They can’t be
bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to
watch the world burn. Every great magic trick consists of three parts or
acts. The first part is called “The Pledge.” The magician shows you
something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this
object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real,
unaltered, normal. But of course… It probably isn’t. The second act is
called “The Turn.” The magician takes the ordinary something and makes
it do something extraordinary. Now you’re looking for the secret… But
you won’t find it, because of course you’re not really looking. You
don’t really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn’t clap
yet. Because making something disappear isn’t enough; you have to bring
it back. That’s why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part,
the part we call “The Prestige.” I don’t reckon you’ve got long. Seen
that before. Gut wound. The slug’s probably torn right through your
liver. Mate of mine in Ulster got caught in sniper fire. Bullet blew his
inside out. He screamed for a good 10 minutes. We couldn’t send a medic
in, the section was too hot. So we all took cover… And watched him die.
I’ve never told that… To anyone… You should’ve called an ambulance… For
the girl. You see only one end to your journey. Leaving is all I have to
make you understand. You’re not Batman anymore. You have to find another
way. You used to talk about finishing, about a life beyond that awful
cave. With respect, Master Wayne, perhaps this is a man that you don’t
fully understand, either. A long time ago, I was in Burma. My friends
and I were working for the local government. They were trying to buy the
loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones. But
their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a
bandit. So we went looking for the stones. But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him. One day, I saw a child playing with a
ruby the size of a tangerine. The bandit had been throwing them
away.</p>

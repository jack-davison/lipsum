“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me
and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
he’–and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of–‘know anything
of a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them
back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have
asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
there be cause I shall come again. The disease–for not to be all well is
a disease–interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too.
She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’
</p>
<p>
“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
me.” 4 September.–Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
something directly. I cannot quite understand it. Later.–Another change
in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on him, and found him
seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies
and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making
nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When
he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me
in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to
have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back
in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out
on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not
now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already
examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him
to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be
of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he
looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying
it rather to himself than to me:–
</p>
<p>
“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
it for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more
sugar? I think it would be good for me.”

<p>Now remember, things look bad and it looks like you’re not gonna make
it, then you gotta get mean. I mean plumb, mad-dog mean. ’Cause if you
lose your head and you give up then you neither live nor win. That’s
just the way it is.</p>
<p>I’m not doing this because I want to take long showers with you
assholes and I don’t want to get my head shot off in some far away land
because you don’t habla, comprende?</p>
<p>God this stuff isn’t getting to me - the shootings, the knifings, the
beatings. Old ladies being bashed in the head for their social security
checks. Nah that doesn’t bother me. But you know what does bother me?
You know what makes me really sick to my stomach? It’s watching you
stuff your face with those hotdogs! Nobody - I mean nobody puts ketchup
on a hot dog!</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well
to tell you the truth in all this excitement I’ve kinda lost track
myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum - the most powerful hand gun in
the world and would blow your head clean off, you’ve got to ask yourself
one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya punk!</p>
<p>There’s a rebel lying deep in my soul. Anytime anybody tells me the
trend is such and such, I go the opposite direction. I hate the idea of
trends. I hate imitation; I have a reverence for individuality.</p>

This is not to discredit the idea that an oboe is a buffer from the
